Git Version control system

Version control
the management of changes to documents,computer programs,large websites, and other collections of  information

Terms
directory   -- folder
cli --- command line interface 
ls- la to list all the items including hidden files (la) for mac
COde editor  -- word processor for writing code
repository  -- proect, or folder/place where your project is
Github -- a website to host  your repositories online

Git commands

clone -- bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like github into a folder on your local machine 
add -- track your files and changes in git
commit -- save your files in git
push --upload git commits to a remote repo, like github
pull -- download changes from remote repo to your  local  machine, the opposite of push
.md file 


git

git status -- which shows the  changes eventhough not tracked
git add */file -- then we can track
git commit -m  -- to commit the changes


SSH keys :

 to push changes from local machine to git hub you have to prove that you are owner of this account for that you need to generate the ssh key by using this command

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com" --  here t stands for type of encryption and emailid
ssh-keygen is also enough

enter 'filename' to store the key

sshkey   -- private
sshkey   -- public (we have to copy this we will enter in github)

after adding to github
then we need ssh key to ssh agent


1.eval $(ssh-agent -s)
2.ssh-add ~/(inpath)/filename

PROCESS
git init -- create repository locally
git add /* -- to track files
git commit -m 'message' -- to commit changes
git push origin master  -- to push
git remote add origin url -- create a repository in github and paste here
git remote -v  -- to check
git push -u origin master  -- -u is used here to avoid typing whole in the next time

Git branching:

Master Branch  -- default or main branch
Feature Branch -- 
You cant see the edits or commits which is done in feature branch in master branch and vice versa.
